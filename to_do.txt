- Create fake data
- Fix the timestamp
- Rotation transformation
- What about the calibration data
- Does the positioning of the cameras matter
- How should the markers be placed & does the size of the markers matter
- What does "is_recording" mean?
- how to stop
- if rigid body is tracking invalid then record that in kafka
   - When first rigid body message received send al00 to kafka
   - When validity changes, send relevant al00 message (OK for valid & MAJOR for invalid)
   - Then every 10 secs resend the last update including the original timestamp
- allow main to take arguments for broker and optitrack ip address, e.g. python main --kafka 127.0.0.1 --ip localhost
